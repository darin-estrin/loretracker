# Lore Tracker

##  About

> Sometimes D&D campaigns can go for months, and sometimes there can be long gaps in those campaign. During those gaps its not uncommon for players to forget certain NPC's and forget what their player does and doesn't know. With Dungeons & Data, that won't be a problem anymore.

## How it Works

1. User creates on account

2. If the user is a DM
    * The DM will create a campaign
    * The DM will add any information about the campaign that they feel is imortant such as NPC Bio's, an image of the NPC, etc.
    * The DM will invite players to the campaign
    * The DM will be able to share with either the team or just single players any information they feel the players should know.

3. If the user is a player
    * The player will wait for and accept an invite from the DM
    * The player will just sit back and wait for the DM the share the information that the DM feels needs to be shared.
